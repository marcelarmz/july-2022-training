      As a child, Jacob Magellan Portman has been fascinated with his
      grandfather Abraham's stories about surviving as a Jew during World War
      II, running from man-eating monsters, and living with peculiar children in
      a secret home guarded by "a wise old bird." As Jacob grows older, he
      begins to doubt the stories until the arrival of his grandfather's death.
      Blood-strewn, exhausted, and lying in his back garden on the outskirts of
      Florida Woods, Abraham's last words are a mystery: "...find the bird in
      the loop on the other side of the old man's grave on September 3, 1940,
      and tell them what happened." As his grandfather dies, Jacob catches sight
      of a horrific monster just like the ones described in Abraham's stories.
      Soon, he starts experiencing trauma and being plagued with nightmares
      relating to those monsters. Believing their son to be going crazy, Jacob's
      parents take him to Dr. Golan, a psychiatrist, who suggests that Jacob go
      to Cairnholm, Wales, the location of his grandfather's children's home to
      confront the place of his trauma. On his own, Jacob locates and explores
      the old house only to find it empty and everything caked in dust.
      According to the local people, the place is haunted and a bomb had killed
      all its inhabitants many years ago, on September 3, 1940.
