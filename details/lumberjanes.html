      The story is set in and around Miss Qiunzella Thiskwin Penniquiqul Thistle
      Crumpet's Camp for Hardcore Lady Types, a summer camp whose attendees are
      known as Lumberjane Scouts. The five scouts of the Roanoke cabin—Jo,
      April, Molly, Mal and Ripley—witness a mysterious old woman transforming
      into a bear, and after following her into the woods, encounter a hostile
      pack of three-eyed supernatural foxes. As more three-eyed creatures start
      to appear, the girls task themselves with solving the mysteries
      surrounding the camp.

      Over the course of the story, characters earn or refer to various
      Lumberjane scout badges. The characters frequently invoke the names of
      notable female pioneers, with phrases such as "Oh my Bessie Coleman" and
      "What the Joan Jett?" Each of the first seven issues ends with a
      track listing for a mixtape prepared by one of the characters.
