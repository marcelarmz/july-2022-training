      The year is 1898, and Mina Murray is recruited by Campion Bond on behalf
      of British Intelligence and asked to assemble a league of other
      extraordinary individuals to protect the interests of the Empire: Captain
      Nemo, Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll, and Hawley Griffin the Invisible Man.
      They help stop a gang war between Fu Manchu and Professor Moriarty,
      nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. Following this they take part in the events of
      H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. Two members of the League (Mina
      Murray and Allan Quatermain) achieve immortality, and are next seen in an
      adventure in 1958. This follows events that take place after the fall of
      the Big Brother government from Nineteen Eighty Four.

      Following this Mina and Allan team up with fellow immortal Orlando and are
      shown in an adventure which spans a century, from 1910 to 2009, concerning
      a plot by evil magicians to create a Moonchild that might well turn out to
      be the Antichrist. During this adventure Captain Nemo's daughter, Janni
      Dakkar, is introduced, and some of her adventures are chronicled
      subsequently. The final volume of the series ends with an immortal Mina
      escaping an earth dominated by magical entities and various alien
      invasions to live out her immortal life on a space station with Orlando,
      Jack Nemo (great-grandson of Captain Nemo) and a clone of Mr. Hyde.
