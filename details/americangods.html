      Shadow is an ex-convict who is released from prison three days early when
      his wife Laura is killed in a car accident. Shadow is devastated by her
      death, and is distraught to learn that she died alongside his best friend
      Robbie, with whom she had been having an affair. He takes a job as a
      bodyguard for a mysterious con man, Mr. Wednesday, and travels with him
      across the United States, visiting Wednesday's acquaintances. Shadow meets
      a leprechaun named Mad Sweeney, who gives Shadow a magical gold coin after
      Shadow beats him in a fight. Shadow later tosses the coin into his wife's
      grave at her funeral, inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a
      semi-living revenant. Shadow meets Czernobog and the Zorya Sisters. One of
      the sisters gives Shadow a silver coin, coming from the moon, that will
      protect him. Shadow learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the
      All-Father, and that he is recruiting American manifestations of the Old
      Gods, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number,
      to participate in a battle against the New American Gods – manifestations
      of modern life and technology, such as the Internet, media, and modern
      means of transport. Shadow meets many of Wednesday's allies, including Mr.
      Nancy (Anansi), Easter (Ēostre), Whiskey Jack (Wisakedjak) and John
      Chapman (Johnny Appleseed).
